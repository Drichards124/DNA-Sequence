# DNA Sequencing for Detecting Ecoli

## In this project, the aim is to harness the predictive power of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier, a class of feedforward artificial neural network, to analyze and classify sequences from a DNA dataset. The primary objective is to accurately categorize small segments of DNA into their respective nucleotide basesâ€”adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). Utilizing an MLP Classifier's robust neural net architecture, we anticipate achieving high accuracy in classification tasks with relatively short training durations, transforming complex biological data into actionable insights with potential applications in genomics and bioinformatics.
